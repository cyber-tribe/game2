 * Volcano rock (see applyVolcano/rockHardness) used to just render as

 * feedback narrowed this down:
 *
 * 1. A single hardness→orange gradient across the *entire* tile just read
 *    as a brown/orange mountain — nothing in it looked dark enough to
 *    contrast against. Real depictions (Terraria's Underworld, Stardew
 *    Valley's Volcano Dungeon, Minecraft's lava) keep the rock itself dark
 *    (obsidian/ash/charcoal) and show lava as a small, separately colored
 *    bright element against that dark base.
 * 2. Glowing cracks scattered across *every* rock tile still wasn't it —
 *    ordinary volcano art (see the reference image) shows magma only near
 *    the top, flowing down the slope in a few distinct streams, with the
 *    rest of the cone plain dark rock. applyVolcano raises its whole
 *    footprint to a flat MAX_ELEVATION plateau (no gradual cone slope to
 *    speak of), so the closest equivalent of "the slope" is the rim where
 *    that plateau meets ordinary lower ground. So lava is drawn only on
 *    rim tiles (isRockTile with a non-rock/out-of-bounds neighbor) as a
 *    streak spilling from that shared edge toward the lower ground;
 *    interior tiles (surrounded by other rock tiles on all sides) stay
 *    plain dark rock, same as the cone body in the reference image.
 *
 * Cools toward nothing as raiseVertex chips rockHardness down, per
 * "頑張れば平地に戻せる" (heightmap.ts's rockHardness doc comment).
